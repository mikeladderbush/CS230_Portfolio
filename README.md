These are my recommendations regarding which platforms and development tools the developers at The Gaming Room should use in order to create a secure and responsive cross platform capable web application.

I believe one of the biggest strengths of my recommendations is the fact that each recommendation was made with every facet of the design incorporated. If this guide is followed there should be a very powerful synergy between all of the tools and platforms listed.

I believe that using this template for my own development of a working model helped me to understand what my client would need further down the line in their own developement cycle.

If I had to rework part of the template I would probably go back to the start and update the clients issues to better explain why each design limitation would be particularly challenging on different platforms.

I interpretted the users needs by developing a software model that reflected what the client asked for as well as expanding my own recommendations to accommodate the future challenges of the project.

I approached this design with scalability and ease of access in mind. I believed that in order to have a successful cross-platform application that could handle what the client required I would need to focus on what would allow the application to be as robust, responsive, and easily maintained as possible. In the future I plan to recommend clients make use of cloud-based services as early in development as possible in order to reduce costs and potentially gain the benefits of scalability and reliability of those tools.
